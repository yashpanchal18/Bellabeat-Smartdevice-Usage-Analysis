# Bellabeat Case Study â€“ Smart Device Usage Analysis  

## Project Overview  
This case study analyzes user activity data from Bellabeat smart devices to uncover usage trends, behavioral insights, and recommendations for improving Bellabeatâ€™s product marketing strategy. The project focuses on one of Bellabeat's key products, the **Time wellness watch**, which tracks activity, sleep, and stress.  

## Business Task  
Identify how users interact with Bellabeat's smart devices and provide actionable insights to guide future marketing decisions.  

## Data Source  
The dataset was made publicly available through [FitBit Fitness Tracker Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit).  
Data used in this project includes:  
- Daily activity  
- Sleep tracking  
- Heart rate  
- Step counts  
- Calorie expenditure  
- Weight and BMI  

## Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**: Data cleaning, analysis, and statistical exploration  
- **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**: EDA and visualizations  
- **Power BI**: Data modeling and interactive dashboard creation  

## Data Cleaning & Preparation  
Performed using Python. Key steps:  
- Merged and standardized datasets  
- Converted date/time formats for consistency  
- Removed duplicates and null values  
- Created features for analysis (e.g., active minutes by intensity level)  

## ðŸ“Š Analysis Summary  
- Users with higher activity minutes tend to burn more calories  
- Peak heart rate aligns with working hours, showing usersâ€™ most active periods  
- Longer sleep durations correlate with lower step counts  
- Majority of users are in a sedentary category, with very few being highly active  
- Activity is lower on weekends compared to weekdays

## Dashboard Overview  

An interactive Power BI dashboard was created to summarize all key metrics and trends from the analysis.  
It includes:  
- Daily activity and step trends  
- Sleep vs activity comparisons  
- Heart rate by hour  
- Weekly and user-level behavioral patterns  
- Calorie burn vs intensity correlations

**Insight Highlights:**  
- Majority of users are sedentary and need engagement nudges  
- Active minutes and calorie burn have a strong direct relationship  
- Users are less active on weekends  
- Peak activity (heart rate) aligns with daytime routines  
- Higher sleep duration often links to lower step counts

## Recommendations  
- Develop personalized notifications to encourage higher activity levels in sedentary users  
- Promote weekend wellness campaigns to balance out drop in activity  
- Introduce sleep/activity balance insights in the app to guide healthier routines  
- Market Time as a lifestyle tool to promote habit-building among less active users
